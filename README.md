# Knowledge 

Welcome to my digital brain-dump. 
A gloriously chaotic, semi-organized stash of software engineering know-how.

Think of it as Stack Overflow meets a diary, but with fewer existential crises (maybe).
Here you'll find everything from bug-fixing rituals and deployment incantations to design patterns I pretend to understand and shortcuts I definitely shouldn’t be using in production. 

Whether you're me-from-the-future trying to remember how something works, or a curious teammate wondering why the pipeline is held together with duct tape and hope this is the place.

    - Upfront design, stop when you can answer: 
    - Understand architecture drivers (req, constraints) 
    - Know the context and scope of what building 
    - Understand the significant design decision  
    - Have a way to communicate vision 
    - Confident design satisfied drivers 
    - Identified and comfortable with the risks  
    ```
